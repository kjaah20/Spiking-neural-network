Matlab implementation of a conductance-based neuronal network

A conductance-based neuronal network of 200 cells containing 160 excitatory (e-cells) and 40 inhibitory (i-cells) neurons. Neurons were modeled by Hodgkin–Huxley dynamics. Gaussian noise generated by a wiener process was added to the voltages at each integration step. The magnitude of the noise was 0.5 mV2 /ms for the e-cells. The equations were integrated using Euler’s method with a time step of 0.025 ms. To achieve heterogeneity, the input currents (I0 ) were varied in the range from 0.6 to 2.0 μA/cm2 to the e-cells and from 1 to 1.1 μA/cm2 to the i-cells.  The network model incorporate synaptic dynamics.

This work was part of my PhD Thesis and research publications:-

AbuHassan, K. (2013). Modelling synaptic loss, compensation mechanisms and neural oscillations in Alzheimer's Disease (Doctoral dissertation, University of Ulster).

To run the model, type _HodgkinHuxley4_ in the command window. Note that _HodgkinHuxley4.m_ and _wiener.m_ should be at the same directory. 

The code outputs the raster plot and the power spectra of the network oscillatory activity. More information can be found in the above paper.
